### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a former sales and customer-service guy with an engineering education, now gladly reconverting to become a programmer.

Iâ€™m currently learning Web Dev through different courses: [Learn Enough](https://www.learnenough.com/), [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn) and [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/).
Some of the modest achievements in my journey so far:
