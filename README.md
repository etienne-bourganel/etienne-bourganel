### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a former sales and customer service guy with an engineering edication, now gladly reconverting to become a programmer.

Iâ€™m currently learning Web Dev through different courses: Learn Enough, Odin Project and I am also learning Golang.

Some of the modest achievements in my journey so far:
